# What is Easy-WI?
First of all Easy-Wi is a Web-interface that allows you to manage server daemons like gameservers. In addition it provides you with a CMS which includes a fully automated game- and voiceserver lending service. The development goal is always to automate as far as possible. The daily work which requires an administrator should be reduced to a minimum.

# Information
Das EasyWi Webinterface wurde in ein Docker container gepackt.
